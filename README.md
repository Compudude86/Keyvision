this system is designed in resoonse to the senseless lives lost, construction workers supporting their families, who worked on the Francis Scott Key bridge, while an advance notice was given to traffic, was not given to the road workers maintaining the highway, as they were the primary casualty. I have created this open source project, as the son of a road worker, to create a notification system to alert road workers in advance to prevent casualty of those that maintain our infrastructure, in such a way to prevent monetization of a system to notifying people at risk of death, and allow input from oarties who may better help the project in such a way to protect life without monetary copensation or licensing fees
